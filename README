These set of scripts have been used for PMF analysis of FTIR, STXM-NEXAFS, and ACSM spectra. Provided are scripts for running PMF and visualizing outputs (factor profiles, explained variation, Q-values, correlations in factor strengths/contributions). There are additional scripts provided for cluster analysis and visualization on the same data matrix using the Ward algorithm (Ward, 1963) implemented in R. Additional scripts for fixed-size moving window analysis and visualization of residual element correlations for FTIR data sets are included.

The primary requirements are matrix.dat, std_dev.dat, samples.txt, and variables.txt; helper functions to generate these matrices are provided for some measurement types.

---Instructions---

From the PMF_CD.zip provided by P. Paatero,

copy PMF_CD/PMF2key.key to C:/PMF/
copy PMF_CD/PMFx/pmf2wopt.exe to C:/PMF/
copy PMF_CD/PMFx/Exampl_2/pmf2def.ini to C:/PMF/

In Windows (on PC or as virtual machine):
- install R, add C:\Program Files\R\R-x.xx\bin to Environment Path

In either Windows (guest) or Mac/Linux OS (host):
- edit userinputs.r
- place input matrices and vector definitions in runs/FOLDER/

In Windows:
- open DOS terminal in Windows
- type: Rscript --no-save runpmf.r
